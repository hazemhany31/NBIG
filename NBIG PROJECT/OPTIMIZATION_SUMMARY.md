## How to Use the Optimized Files

### Option 1: Replace Original Files
```bash
# Backup originals first
cp index.html index_backup.html
cp css/nbig.css css/nbig_backup.css
cp js/animations.js js/animations_backup.js
cp js/main.js js/main_backup.js

# Replace with optimized versions
cp index_optimized.html index.html
cp css/nbig_optimized.css css/nbig.css
cp js/animations_optimized.js js/animations.js
cp js/main_optimized.js js/main.js
```

### Option 2: Use Optimized Files Directly
Simply update your HTML to reference the optimized files:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/nbig_optimized.css">
<script src="js/animations_optimized.js" defer></script>
<script src="js/main_optimized.js" defer></script>
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Deployment:
1. **Cross-browser Testing:** Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
2. **Mobile Testing:** Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes
3. **Performance Testing:** Use Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights
4. **Accessibility Testing:** Use WAVE or axe DevTools
5. **Form Testing:** Ensure contact form works correctly
6. **Animation Testing:** Verify all animations work smoothly

### Performance Metrics to Monitor:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Should be under 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Should be under 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Should be under 0.1
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** Should be under 3.5s

## Maintenance Notes
